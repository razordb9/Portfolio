                My name is Thomas Zaussnig and that's my selfmade portfolio page. In my 
                spear time I like to do many kind of things e.g. Sport, learn how to code and 
                a little bit of photography.

                I started my career in IT as a IT technican apprentice 18 years ago. After 
                military service I worked as a customer call center agent. Half a year later 
                I got a position as IT system administrator which I run for 11 years. In this
                time I worked on several big project in my company which I was responsible for.
                During that time I also decided to attend the HTL Moessingerstra√üe for 4 years 
                to do the Matura which is the same as a High School Diploma.

                In January 2019 I quite my job and joined Infineon Austria as a System Engineer 
                for Windows client support.  At the moment I work since November 2020 as Software 
                Packager for the SCCM team.
