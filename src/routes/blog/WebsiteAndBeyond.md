# Website and Beyond
CTA - Call to action
## The Use of colors in designing websites

Color can increase brand recognition by up to 80%

Throughout your web development career, you’re going to have two kinds of clients:
Type 1: Those who have already decided on a color scheme \
Type 2: Those who still need help with their colors

What if you feel that your client is using the wrong color?
This is where you can and should add more value to your client.
What if you think a funeral company’s choice of red is conveying the wrong message?
Simple questions like:
* Why did you choose your current brand color?
* How do you feel about it?
* Have you received feedback from customers about how they feel about this color?
* What image would you like to portray for your company?

Research by the Institute for Color Research reveals that people make a subconscious assessment of an environment, person or product within 90 seconds of initial viewing – and between 62% and 90% of that assessment is based on color alone.

Colors have different impacts on our perception and your choice of color can significantly impact users’ first impression on your client’s brand and overall experience on the website.
The way you use color can increase or decrease people’s trust on the website and turn them into loyal customers or not.

When people land on your website, you want them to:
* Trust the website/business
* Be convinced enough to stay on the website
* Persuaded to perform the desired action (CTA)
Everything you do in your design should support these goals.

## Basic Colors and Their Impact on Our Perception

### Red: The Color of Power and Urgency

Red portrays urgency, passion, emergency, survival, courage and aggressiveness, but its shades have slightly different meanings.
Shades of Red
Bright red: energetic, exciting; great for food, beverage, entertainment, adventure companies.

Dark red: authoritative, luxurious; good for companies selling high-priced products and services, educational institutions.

### Blue: The Hue of Trust

If you want to create a sense of trust, safety, calmness and productivity, blue is the right color. It gives people a feeling of serenity and peace.

If in doubt, blue is always a ‘safest’ color to choose, however, it can also give the perception of no emotion or coldness if not used correctly.

You will often find blue in businesses/organizations/sectors like:
* Banks
* Finance and Insurance companies
* Tech companies
* Medical/Healthcare Institutions

Light blue: creativity and tranquility; great for tech and travel companies. \
Dark blue: intelligence, trust; great for companies that need to build trust like financial institutions, healthcare, government organizations and corporations.

### Green: Money, Balance, Health and Nature

Green is in the center of the color spectrum, making it the color of balance, natural,
healthy, growing, nature, and calm.

It is a versatile color that works great in most industries and its shade variations matter less than in other colors.
You will often find green in businesses/organizations/sectors like:
* Health and Wellness
* Tech Companies 
* Nutrition/Organic 
* Money

### Yellow: Creative, Unique, Playful, Digital

Yellow is the ‘happiest’ color and makes you feel excited, optimistic, and open to possibilities.
Companies that want to evoke cheerful feelings would often use yellow to come across as friendly and delightful.

### Orange: Urgency, Durable, Confident
If you want to convey a sense of urgency in a non-intrusive way, orange may be the right fit.

Orange is a great color to draw attention.
You will often find orange in businesses/organizations/sectors like:
* Activity/Outdoors • Sports
* Food
* Marketing
* Logistics

### Pink: Calmness, Love, Femininity, Vibrancy, Youthfulness
Pink can influence emotions and has a lot of different meanings. It often represents calmness, love, youthfulness and femininity.
You will often find pink in businesses/organizations/sectors like:
* Makeup and Beauty
* Female Products
* Wedding Planning
* Baking
* Child-related
* Innovative Companies

Light pink: generally appeals to women’s sense of class and sophistication; great for companies selling products to women like clothing, jewelry and beauty items.

### Black: Bold, Classy, Luxury
Black is a lot more sophisticated than purple, making it a good color for brands that cater to the wealthiest clientele, i.e. the luxury market.
Proper use of black lets you create a high level of contrast, helping a website in any industry to make a bold statement.
If you or your client is selling high-end products or services like:
* Expensive Consumer Goods
* Cosmetics
* Fashion
* Butler Service

### White: Friendly, Sophisticated, Classy
When in doubt, use white.
White is simple and fuss-free but still classy, sophisticated, inviting, and friendly.
White is best paired with strong, bold colors to create a clean, minimalist effect that is still easy to read.

## Tips for Using Colors in Web Design

### White Space is a MUST

A lack of white space (or negative space) is one of the biggest design issues I see web developers make.
What do I mean by white space?
It’s the area on a website page that is blank with no text or images.
2 Takeaways:
1. White space doesn’t have to be ‘white’ in color. 
1. White space serves a specific purpose.

Have you ever landed on a website and your eyes instantly 'hurt' because of all the colors, or maybe you were just so confused about what the business actually does?
This is exactly what white space helps with. Some other benefits:
* Proper use of white space in margins and in between lines of paragraphs increases comprehension by almost 20%.
* It allows you to separate texts, images and sections so that you can present individual ideas/concepts in a more organized way.
* White space creates balance. Too much white space gives the impression that your website lacks content, but a lack of it leads to disorganization and confusion.
* It lets you highlight CTAs by creating high levels of contrast.
* Mobile – mobile traffic is increasing significantly and if you want to get the right message across, it needs to be simple with no distractions.

Take note of the page margin, heading space, line height in paragraphs and image padding.
The only thing different between these 2 examples is the use of white space.
You might think that this is just a newspaper example, but this principle applies in web design as well.
Take a look at the following wireframe web design options:

Takeaway: use white space effectively for every page element (images, text, CTA, etc.). 
Double takeaway text comes here for the

Double Takeaway: make sure the white space is the same size. You can’t have a top padding of 30px and a bottom padding of 20px. It just looks weird. Keep it consistent.

When it comes to web design, keeping it simple and focused with the right amount of white space is key. Please don’t forget this.

### Use the colorwheel in selecting your color scheme

The color wheel is a visual representation of the relationships of colors.
Adobe Color is a helpful color wheel tool for easily generating color schemes.
I like using the Analogous and Complementary options on the left side.
Literally just drag the pointer to the color you’re interested in, and it will provide supporting colors.
If you need some color inspiration and don’t know where to start, I like Coolors.co and Design-Seeds.com (filter by color search).
Complementary colors contrast each other and are great highlighting elements like a CTA.

* Color increases brand recognition, highlights important website elements and influences how people feel about a website.
* Different colors produce different emotions in people, so it's important to choose the right colors.
* White space, contrast and good color schemes are vital elements of good web design.

## Buttons

Buttons are not just little rectangular blobs on a screen.
They play a crucial part in interacting with a website and getting the desired results.
As a starter, it’s important to remember that a button should not create more doubts like if it’s actually a button or what the next step should be.
A button needs to LOOK clickable, be CLEARLY visible and GUIDE the next step. So there are 3 main takeaways:
* A button needs to look clickable.
* A button needs to be clearly visible.
* A button needs to guide the next step.

### Size

Size
As a general rule for sizing, the left and right padding should be 2X the top and bottom padding.
